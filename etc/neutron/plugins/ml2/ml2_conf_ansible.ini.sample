# *** Please read carefully ***
#
# - ansible:port_mappings is a a reserved section for mapping compute service
#   hosts to physical switches. The key is the host name that the neutron port
#   object will return from HOST_ID when created. The value is a switch name
#   defined in a subsequent ansible:switch_name section and a port name
#   separated from the switch name by a double colon (::). A single colon (:)
#   can be used in naming ports. For SRIOV DIRECT port attachments append the
#   PCI address to the HOST_ID.
# - All other sections represents a switch ansible will configure.
#   the 'ansible:' tag will be stripped out and the rest of the section name
#   is used as switch_name. switch_name cannot contain a :
# - The variables in each section will be passed directly to the inventory file
#   ansible will use. The variables you can use here are defined by ansible.
#   If you uses an ansible host variable that is not represented here but
#   is supported by the installed version of ansible then the variable should
#   work as defined by ansible
# - Non-ansible variables used only by net-ansible
#   * manage_vlans :: Default: True
#     Defines whether to create and delete vlans on the switch.
# - Extra Parameters
#   These are standardized parameters used by the network_runner ansible roles
#   * stp_edge :: Default: False
#     Enable spanning tree protocol on ports
# - Custom parameters are collected and passed directly to the ansible role
#   for the platform being configured. These parameters are denoted by the
#   prefix cp_ which is stripped off before passed to the ansible role.
